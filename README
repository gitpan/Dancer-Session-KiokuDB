NAME
    Dancer::Session::KiokuDB - KiokuDB Dancer session backend

VERSION
    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
        # in your Dancer app:
        setting session              => 'KiokuDB';
        setting kiokudb_backend      => 'DBI';
        setting kiokudb_backend_opts => {
            dsn => 'dbi:SQLite:dbname=mydb.sqlite',
        };

        # or in your Dancer config file:
        session:         'KiokuDB'
        kiokudb_backend: 'DBI'
        kiokudb_backend_opts:
            dsn: 'dbi:SQLite:dbname=mydb.sqlite'

DESCRIPTION
    When you want to save session information, you can pick from various
    session backends, and they each determine how the session information
    will be saved. You can use Dancer::Session::Cookie,
    Dancer::Session::MongoDB or... you use Dancer::Session::KiokuDB.

    This backend uses KiokuDB to save and access session data.

OPTIONS
  kiokudb_backend
    A string which specifies what backend to use, under "KiokuDB::Backend",
    that means that backend *DBI* will be "KiokuDB::Backend::DBI". If you'll
    get smart and provide *KiokuDB::Backend::Cool*, you'll get
    "KiokuDB::Backend::KiokuDB::Backend::Cool", which is, evidently, not
    cool! :)

    Not mandatory.

    The default backend is KiokuDB::Backend::Hash.

  kiokudb_backend_opts
    A hash reference which indicates options you want to send to the
    backend's "new()" method.

    Not mandatory.

    The default opts are "<create =" 1>>. If you do not want it to
    automatically create, set:

        # in your app
        set kiokudb_backend_opts => {
            create => 0,
            ...
        };

        # or in your configuration
        kiokudb_backend_opts:
            create: 0

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  init
    Initializes the object by loading the proper KiokuDB backend and
    creating the initial connection.

  create
    Creates a new object, runs "flush" and returns the object.

  flush
    Writes the session information to the KiokuDB session database.

  retrieve
    Retrieves session information from the KiokuDB session database.

  destroy
    Deletes session information from the KiokuDB session database.
