DESCRIPTION
    When you want to save session information, you can pick from various
    session backends, and they each determine how the session information
    will be saved. You can use Dancer::Session::Cookie or
    Dancer::Session::MongoDB or you can now use Dancer::Session::KiokuDB.

    This backend uses KiokuDB to save and access session data.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
